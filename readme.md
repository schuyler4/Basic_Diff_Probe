<h1> 
Basic Diff Probe 
</h1>
I need a differential probe, but I don't need particularly good specs. I don't need very high bandwidth or voltage. This is my solution. 

<img src="circuit_picture.jpg" width="450px">

Here are some specifications:
<ul>
<li> Power Supply: 9V Battery </li>
<li> Bandwidth: 20kHz (1x) / 200Hz (10x) </li>
<li> Offset < 2mV </li>
<li> Maximum Differential Input 10x (1x): 50V (5V) </li>
<li> Minimum Differential Input 10x (1x): -50V (-5V) </li>
<li> Maximum Single Ended Input 10x (1x): 25V (2.5V) </li>
<li> Minimum Differential Input 10x (1x): -25V (-2.5V) </li>
<li> Attenuation Options: 
<ul>
    <li> 10X </li>
    <li> 1X </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Here is an example measurement taken of a sweep from my curve tracer. The purple trace is from the diff probe and the yellow trace is regular single ended oscilloscope measurement.
