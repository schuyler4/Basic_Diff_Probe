<h3>Accuracy Test</h3>
<b>Procedure:</b> Connect a function generator with a sine wave that has a frequency of 1Mhz, and a peak voltage of 25V. Connect the sine wave across the differential probe and a regular calibrated single ended scope probe. Look at both traces on the oscilloscope. 

<b>Acceptance Criteria:</b> Verify that both scope traces are overlaid nicely and there is no distortion or attenuation present in the differential probe trace. 

<h3>Floating Voltage Test</h3>
<b>Procedure:</b> Connect an isolated power supply in series with a grounded power supply. Set the grounded power supply to 20V. Connect the differential probe across the isolated floating power supply. Increase the floating power supply voltage from 1V to 30V. Verify with a DMM that differential probe reads the voltage of the floating power supply. Check the accuracy with respect to the DMM in 5V steps. Reverse the diff probe leads so it reads a negative voltage and repeat the accuracy test. 

<b>Acceptance Criteria:</b> The accuracy with respect to the DMM is less than 2% for all the measured steps.
